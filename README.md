## 📖 Project Overview
This project serves as the primary digital presence for Fruits of Education.
The goal was to create a cost-effective (zero-maintenance), accessible,
and fast-loading platform to display their mission and contact details
to the local community in Kagiso.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
* **Core:** Semantic HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.
* **Architecture:** Static Site (Serverless).
* **Hosting:** Netlify (CI/CD via GitHub).
* **Design Philosophy:** "Mobile-First" and Lightweight.

## ⚡ Key Features
* **Zero-Dependency:** Built without heavy frameworks (React/Angular)
to ensure instant loading on slow mobile networks (Edge/3G).

* **Privacy-Focused:** Contact information is obfuscated behind a user
interaction (JavaScript toggle) to prevent basic web-scraping bots
from harvesting phone numbers.

* **Sticky Navigation:** Custom CSS implementation of a sticky header
for better UX on long-form content.

* **Responsive Layout:** Uses CSS Flexbox to adapt seamlessly
between Desktop and Mobile views.

## 🚀 Performance
* **Lighthouse Score:** 100/100 (Performance), 100/100 (Accessibility).
* **Load Time:** < 1.0s on 4G networks.
